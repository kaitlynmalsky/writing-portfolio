## She has a palace down

She has a palace down  
where the children fall  
Its walls have long been crowned  
with hopeful drawings.  
Suns squared off in corners  
don't shift and don't set.  
They haven't been shaded  
like their Sun has been.  

She keeps cleaning the halls  
though they filth again,  
pages of books have been  
going unreplaced,  
making her speak their words.  
Words still aren't safe  
from the corroding rains  
ordained by the kings.  

She has a palace down  
But what's a palace  
without her disciples  
or their attention  
or their backs on thrones  
or up-to-date maps  
of nations and conquests?  
She couldn't tell you.

Disciples don't care for  
any of those things.  
Disciples want some help  
tying words together.  
And that's talking best case.  
There's another case -  
they fall and don't get up.  
Does the tier count?
