# By The Devil's Tooth

The air in the clinic was cold as Monday gathered gathered her things from the staff room at the far end of the clinic corridor. She quickly pulled her black puffer coat over her scrubs, paying no mind to the sweat underneath. Keys dangled on her neck. She swiftly pulled herself out of the room, the moon shining on her back.

Hospitals are never quiet. Unlike people, they never quite let themselves die. It was 2:02 AM and the hallways were about as empty as anyone’d expect. Much more was heard and felt than seen. The beeps and buzzes and the never-ending stir of equipment underlined everything, and once in a while some familiar faces would move from one room to another, stringing along with them a mix of gossip and professional reports. Having a singular stop planned before she could go home, Monday turned to a room to which no other nurse was paying attention to.

There was no patient staying in room 317 tonight – though, until 6 hours ago, nobody would have bet a cent on that. Matty was wheeled in here last week. A ten-year-old boy. He was found four feet deep in a frozen lake. Even after his body temperature returned to normal, it looked like he had lost too much of his cognitive function to go home any time soon.

This morning, though, by some miracle which most will never know, you couldn’t pass by the room without hearing his voice. The boy was happily chatting with the staff and planning how he’d get in trouble again next weekend, as though nothing had ever happened. Before we knew it, we could unhook him from the cannula from his nose and free him. He might as well have ran out of the hospital.

But Monday knew that room 317 wasn’t empty.

After she was certain that nobody was paying attention to her, she carefully opened the door and pulled back the curtain dividing the bed from the uncaring gleam of blue fluorescent light from the hallway.

Dr. Melody Nightingale sat limp on the bedside chair, coated in blood.

It was an ugly, fantastical sight. Nightingale’s body splayed over the chair, her breath slow and unsteady. A nation’s plague, something biblical, all honed in to a single person. No inch of her body was clean. Blood dripped from pores on her scalp, coating what was left of her thinning hair. Her scrubs clung to her skin in heavy, irregular folds. Seemingly, her back now too was bleeding. The cheap, thin cushions glistened with iron, absorbing as little as they could through their navy-blue plastic exterior.

Monday wrapped her arms around the doctor and hoisted her atop her shoulders. Frail and barely reaching 5 feet tall, she wasn’t the heaviest person that Monday had had to lift up that day. She had no problem laying her down on the bed, and began to pull the sheets over her head, when she noticed Nightingale open her eyes slightly and take in a gasp of air, readying herself to speak.

“Monday... you don’t have to do this.” 

Nightingale pushed the words out as if lifting a heavy weight, after which she had to quickly regain her breath and let her eyes rest.

“We’ve been over this”, Monday replied. “This is too much for you to take on on your own.”

Nightingale attempted to use any of the strength she had, but ultimately it just resulted in a weak nod. She weakly opened her eyes again, not quite breaking the blood encrusted on her lashes and letting the side of her head sink deeper into the mattress. She looked painfully at nobody in particular.

Knowing full well that Nightingale had no words left in her for the night, Monday covered her head with the sheet. She took a look out into the hallway to make sure there would nobody watching and wheeled the bed out into the hall, avoiding any suspicion by adorning her ID badge and her characteristic lack of concern. 

Monday wasted no time in reaching her destination. Before she knew it, she was standing in front of the janitor’s closet, key already in hand. Without turning on the light, she pushed the bed into the closet and transferred the sleeping doctor from the gurney to another bed by its side in the closet.
Monday closed the door on her and the room got darker still.


The next day, light cut past dust through a small slit-window in the corner of the closet. Keys rattled softly. Once again, Monday walked inside. The doctor was no longer there. The gurney was absent and the permanent bed was left undone, the quilt that adorned it now draping the floor. 

Without the urgency or the darkness of last night’s scramble, the strange life that persisted within the room made itself visible. Monday had found a way to ensure that there’d be an actual bed in there. Its frame was composed of a thin plywood veneer, but the simple suggestion of wood stood out against the cold tile and off-white drywall of the room. On the other side, a desk stood. It’s seen some heavy use since Monday first assembled it – the surface was strewn with documents and miscellaneous notes in Mel’s handwriting, scrawled on receipts and wrappers and sides of paper cups and the desk itself. Four coffee cups and a half-eaten stick of beef jerky were brushed off to the desk’s side.

Monday has came to keep the room in order numerous times, but she never really took the time to read any of the notes that she left. She felt like she had some vague idea of what they could be. Today, though, some tiredness within her inspired her to take a look.

The handwriting was difficult to make out. All she could tell from a glance was that each note, regardless of its location, was headlined by a name, first and last. Some names seemed familiar. All she could tell was that at least a few of them were patients. That’s all she could make out before Nightingale stepped in.

She had done a meticulous job of cleaning herself up. Her hair, caked and filthy just last night, was now clear and tied tightly in a low bun. Her eyes, which were aligned around five inches below Monday’s, were filled with a sense of purpose and determination that more than made up for it. Mel is 33, just one year her senior, Monday knew, but her face’s deep-cut wrinkles, sinking through her paper-dry skin, would definitely make one think otherwise. She always looks older and more perplexing than she did yesterday.

Mel nodded her “good afternoon” and went directly to the desk. She sat down dutifully, as if Monday wasn’t standing just inches away.

Her reputation preceded her words. All the staff knew that Dr. Nightingale was on a “winning streak”. Whenever a patient was assigned to her, the tone with which the other doctors talked about them lost all of its concern. The task was already done; she was a miracle worker.

“I have a new patient today”, she said, somehow already scrawling something down on the clipboard in front of her. Her hands were shaking a little.

Of course, everybody knows that miracles don’t exist. Pretending otherwise is just convenient.

A weight sank in the back of Monday’s throat.

“Tracy Miller. Acute kidney failure”, Mel continued. “She’s been in intensive care for a week and there’s no way she’s going to survive without my help.”

And Monday knew that was true. Mel kept going.

“She’s already been on the donor list for years. Her and her family are all hopeful that she’s going to get a transplant. But I know that’s a lie.”

And Monday knew that was true.

“I’m intervening tonight.”

And Monday knew that was true.

Monday knew that Mel wouldn’t employ a curse without reason. She knew that this meant that another person – a whole family, would be spared a great loss. A child might look up and see her mother by her side for another day. A friend is going to have one more person to call out to. A lover wouldn’t need to send their heart over to another, unseen, imaginative side of the universe to know that they are loved.

None of that was enough.

Monday turned to face her.

“You should resign.”

“What?”

“The first time that you did this, you just had a nosebleed and some congestion. Now you’re bleeding all over the furniture and I don’t know if you’re going to come back alive the next day. Can’t you see that you’re slowly killing yourself?”

“Yeah. Of course. But I can save people. With just a touch. How selfish would I have to be to just give up that power? With so many people suffering?”

Monday couldn’t answer. She was shaky, and trying desperately to search for words. Mel tried to keep her composure.

“Look, if this is about the money you need to pay off the janitor for the room, I’ll give you more. I have enough.”

Monday sat down on the bed. Her eyes reached Mel’s level.

“Mel, I love you.”

Mel didn’t seem to be surprised. She smiled and placed her hand on hers, atop Monday’s lap.

“I can see that. I love you too.”

“And that’s why I can’t keep helping you.”

Monday slipped her hand away to her side, causing Mel to flinch, and walked out of the room.


It was the next morning and Mel wasn’t inside the closet as usual. Her body was stuck to Tracy Miller’s bed, her blood coagulated with the sheets. Nobody came to fish her out.

Like she was learning the machinations of her curse for the first time again, she would have to shamble out, roughly figuring out the logistics of her escape. Like a bird learning how to fly.

It was actually kind of exciting.
