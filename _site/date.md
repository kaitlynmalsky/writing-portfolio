How did you get in here?  
It looks nothing like me  
Life-As-It-As  
the vision says:  
you mean  
contact

Don’t you have your own visions?  
clear vision of the future  
do you have to  
know the time  
involve hands  
kill

I don’t believe my heart or its major arteries are the problem  
Not an imaginary place. Unfortunate facial condition. You are in crisis  
Flank pain. If he can do it so can I.  
from those who harbor a desire head-to-head  
But we can always, one cut off; please  
If they break down, two cut off  
Do gloves “help”? skin-to skin  
using this as an excuse  
I wasn’t very kind  
vision becomes Irritating  
stopped drawing  
nothing
