## It is never morning

For a mirror. I only see fluorescent light  
Light which the Sun wouldn't wipe off her brow on the hottest

"Morning", a concept I only hear through whispers  
Whispers and clamors spoken by my visitors

They seek to be something greater  
Greater than the effigies they see in my eyes

Rustling of dryers, shaking of towels, pull of shoestrings  
Shoestrings tied to escape from their own dulling chisels

However crowded my perspective, they face their image alone  
Alone they're not when they don't see the morning
