**nine**

that might have been my ninth alarm  
i wish i could say that i slept through them,  
but each one has been clawing at my feet,  
singing.

the first in comforting platitudes  
the second in story time, sitting cross-legged on the carpet  
the third one lay sleeping at my side  
the fourth was the passers-by, pretending not to see  
the fifth was time. and  
the sixth was love  
the seventh told everyone else i knew, but  
the eighth didn’t want to speak out of turn  
the ninth is

you tell me i am beautiful today and it’s true  
the garden you started at my feet is up to my eyes now  
rose thorn retina

you don’t say it’s all better now  
because things can’t get better when  
nothing

nine unread messages  
love in quick succession  
less than-three

you invited me to see a movie tonight, i said sure  
because who am i to make this about the past  
i see everything, while you are placated with the universe, including myself  
i want to cry while i still can
