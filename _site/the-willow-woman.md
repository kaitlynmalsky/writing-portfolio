**The Willow Woman**

Standing in the clearing of the woods a mile from town, I marked today as the first day I had ever taken directions from the back of a business card.  

TURN LEFT PAST THE CROSSING-POINT OF THE STREAM AND THE ELM  
FOLLOW THE PATH WHERE THE CHOKEBERRIES GROW  
TRACE THE SCENT OF BIRD FEED AND APPLE SMOKE  
AND I WILL BE THERE, DESPERATELY AWAITING YOU.  
(PLEASE DON’T UPSET THE CHICKENS.)  

Usually, nothing frustrates me as much as being expected to follow a set of unclear directions. The younger me, the me who had to be told to look at the camera with \*both\* eyes when getting my school picture taken, would reject the directions after reading the first line. She would be unsure if a “crossing point” must be a bridge or in being on the bank of a stream would suffice. The younger me from last week wouldn’t know what chokeberries are.

But when I reached the elm, uprooted from the ground with its arms needlessly reaching beyond the puny stream, I decided that I could be a me who knows what chokeberries are, if only for one short day. Swallowing my pride, I crossed the elm and did as I was told until I reached a cabin.

The cabin looked like something out of a jigsaw puzzle you’d see in an overpriced art museum gift shop. The entire thing was covered by a towering weeping willow. Its shedded leaves – dead and alive – had littered the cabin’s roof so densely that I couldn’t make out the color of the shingles. I walked up to the front door, where a placard indicated the same name and tagline as the front side of the business card:

THE WILLOW WOMAN  
I FEEL ALL. THE UNCHANGING ARE WELCOMED.

When I knocked the door, I knew right away that I had caused a commotion. The hens in the nearby coop had been alerted, distracted from the corn they were occupied with and directed their eyes at me. Through a cacophony of coos and squawks, I could still hear something inside the cabin.
It sounded like sobbing.

The sobbing drew closer as I heard a set of heavy footsteps marching down a staircase. The door flew open. Aptly named, the person that then stood in front of me was more overwhelming and all-encompassing than the tree could ever be. A giant woman, towering six feet and some, her dark-golden hair grew past her knees.

Neither the embellished belts she carried on her wide hips nor the gaudy jewels worn on eight of her fingers, nor the excessive details of the flowers embroidered on her blouse could take away from her smile, only made softer and sweeter by the tears it was covered with. Before I had a chance to get a better look at her expression, she threw her head onto my shoulder.

“I’m so glad you could find the time to meet me today”, she said, with a warmth that made it sound like she knew me so much better than she actually did.

“Why are you crying?”, I said.

She let me out with some hesitation when I pulled back. She didn’t like the way I said that – I hurt her somehow, as if the reason that she was crying should be obvious.

“Come this way. The tea is almost ready.”

Stepping into her living room was like stepping going back home, and home wasn’t a good place to be. Several photos were placed on the brick perimeter of the fireplace, each image depicting a different smile. A woman standing in front of a hospital, face flushed with conquest. An older couple looking at each other with younger eyes. A man standing in front of a prison, his hopeful feet perpendicular to the gate. 

The kettle turned off and my host placed it on a plain cork coaster on the coffee table, next to a fat stack of papers of various ages, littered with little colored tabs. The woman looked at me tenderly. She let the silence exist until she collected herself enough to speak. 

“I’m so sorry for how I appear today. It’s difficult to keep myself together the days I listen to funerals.” True to her word, she held a dusty tape recorder by her side, the buttons’ print worn with use.

Knowing which funeral she was talking about didn’t require any guesswork out of me. My mother’s funeral was last week, and it was the only thing anybody in my life ever talked about now.

I poured myself a cup of tea with one of the cups already available on the table. I took a sip and promptly burned the tip of my tongue;  the tea was so hot that I could almost see it bubbling from inside the cup.  A hiss. The woman sharply inhaled, as if my pain had been magically transferred over to her, and apologized for putting out the tea too soon.

There’s something that always seems performative about conversations with people who’ve experienced pain you’ve never experienced. Yet she can do it just fine. I don’t know how she could live a life like that, with that automatic mirroring. It’s not that I feel nothing – I really don’t – but knowing exactly what to say and exactly how to shape your face in these instances doesn’t just require empathy. It turns every conversation to a challenge where you keep an exact pulse on the other party. I can’t do it. When somebody tells me about the messy breakup they had or that they had, all I can do is say “sorry that happened” and distract them with something else. What happened happened. 

This just doesn’t work in funerals.

My eulogy played back in my memory. The altar squeaked with my footsteps in the back of my mind.

“Mom and I don’t talk any more. If you lived with her for your entire life and knew her like I have, you wouldn’t talk to her much either. I think that the best thing that everybody here can do is move on.”

I don’t need to tell you for you to know that that didn’t go over well.

“How do you do it?” I asked. “I don’t know how to feel whenever somebody asks it of me. You saw the recording.”

The Willow Woman sharpened up.

“It’s not unlike a performance, right?”

I nodded after some hesitation. “The funerals. The flowers. The endless barrage of letters. It’s all fake.”

“It might be. Let’s just say it is. Then the apathy might be fake as well.”
