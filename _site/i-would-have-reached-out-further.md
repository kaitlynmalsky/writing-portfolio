**i would have reached out further**

i would have reached out further  
but each time i do,  
it doesn’t feel like anyone has that  
pa para pa pa pa  
or the ludida ludida ludida-da  
that it seems i've picked up  
and even if someone had that  
rada dada dada da  
or even that trililililili li  
and "mada naka-naka naka naka-naka mada ma"   
was branded on the inner lining of their lungs  
and they h¬ad to carefully count their breaths  
to prevent la la bidi ba bidi ba's,  
like hot steam from a kettle,  
from bursting their way out from every orifice,  
i'd pay them a visit  
and we'd smile and laugh and stride, light-legged  
atop vast, unruly waters  
both holding our breaths so we'd never need to swim  
and, at the end, neither of us learned that the waters taste of  
sha la la la tra la la shin ton shan  
and that sweet stickiness  
had kept our bodies dry.
